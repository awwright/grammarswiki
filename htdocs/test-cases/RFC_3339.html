    <h2>1. What is the grammar/format for {title}, and why is it used?</h2>
    <p>
    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level  protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. 
    HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. The first version of HTTP, referred to as HTTP/0.9, was a simple protocol for raw data transfer across the Internet.<br><br>  

    HTTP/1.0, as defined by RFC 1945 [6], improved the protocol by allowing messages to be in the format of MIME-like messages, containing meta-information about the data transferred and modifiers on the request/response semantics. However, HTTP/1.0 does not sufficiently take into consideration the effects of hierarchical proxies, caching, the need for persistent connections, or virtual hosts. In addition, the proliferation of incompletely-implemented applications calling themselves "HTTP/1.0" has necessitated a protocol version change in order for two communicating applications to determine each other's true 
    capabilities. This specification defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1".<br><br>
